3. `npm run compile`
4. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser

## How to execute examples:

1. Install node and npm (`npm -v` and `node -v` should work)
2. Go to `examples` folder and execute `npm install`
3. Go get a nice cup of coffee
4. Run `npm run server` to execute the dummy server required for examples
5. Execute examples with `node <example_file.js>`, remember that the dummy server must be running
6. Execute the live example with `node workshop/desatranques_jaen.js`, this does not require the dummy server
